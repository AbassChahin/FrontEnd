                        <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
                        <p>Game sales are scattered across countless platforms, storefronts, and launchers, making it hard to know where the best deal actually is. We exist to solve that problem. Our goal is to eliminate the hassle of checking multiple sites by bringing game discounts together in one place. By consolidating sales across platforms, we help players make smarter buying decisions, <strong>save money</strong>, and <strong>spend less time</strong> searching and more time playing.</p>

                        <h1>Built For Gamers</h1>
                        <p>Unlike individual storefronts, we don't push one platform over another. Our focus is transparency, showing current sales across multiple platforms in one place, so you can compare prices easily and choose what works best for you. This platform was built by gamers who were tired of jumping between stores and launchers just to find a good deal. We know how frustrating that can be, which is why we designed a simple, no-nonsense way to track sales and discover games worth playing.</p>
